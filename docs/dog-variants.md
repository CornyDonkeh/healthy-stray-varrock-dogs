# Dog appearance catalogue

NPC follower IDs were read from the OSRS Wiki's structured page data on 2026-09-10 and checked against the local game cache. Item and POH IDs are not used. RuneLite 1.12.38 has no gameval NPC constants for these new pets, so DogVariant temporarily names these verified numeric IDs; migrate to gameval constants when available.

Native animations were verified using RuneLite's NpcManager on a copy of the game cache: all variants walk with `AnimationID.DOG_UPDATE_WALK`; all idle with `DOG_UPDATE_SMALL_DOG_READY` except Labrador and Chihuahua puppies, which use `DOG_UPDATE_SMALL_DOG_READY_SIMPLE`. The plugin loads models, recolors, and scale from the selected NPC definition. No game cache files are edited and no runtime network requests are added.

## Manual acceptance checks

- Default healing: brown west-gate dog, grey strays, and Duke retain their coat colors.
- Random mode with only Corgi puppy/fawn checked: all unnamed strays become that exact puppy; Duke stays healed and grey.
- Switch to only adult Corgi/fawn: verify adult size, color, idle, walking, and turning.
- Select several combinations: only selected appearances occur; no changing breeds while watching a loaded dog. Leaving the area and returning gives a fresh roll, which may repeat.
- No favorites or random mode off: normal healing. Master switch off: original injured models. Re-enable, relog, and hop worlds: no orphaned replacements.
- Check right-click options, overhead text, existing pet/shoo interactions, and using food on a dog, with random mode both off and on. Cosmetic models do not add server actions.
- Watch an ordinary healed stray walking: legs must animate rather than slide. Repeat for Duke and a favorite breed.
- Repeat visibility and interaction checks with GPU enabled and disabled (and any other renderer you use). Look for doubled original/replacement models. Rendering-only suppression must leave the original NPC's native click target intact.
- Test representatives of every breed and both ages, including Labrador/Chihuahua puppies with their distinct idle animation.
